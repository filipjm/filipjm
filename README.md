<p>
  As a statistician and GIS consultant with expertise in spatial statistics, I have always been fascinated by the unknown and the uncertain in the space around us. I embarked on this journey by earning a Bachelor's degree in statistics and computer science, and am now continuing it by pursuing a PhD in statistics / geography.
My primary research focus is on statistical regionalisation, with a particular interest in optimal strategies for spatial partitioning. I am well-versed in a range of partitioning algorithms, cluster modelling, and spatial processes analysis. 
  
  Previously, I worked as a senior research assistant at QUT, where I worked on spatial optimisation and partitioning problems using clustering, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-based algorithms. I have also lead the development and statistical analysis of a project assessing the community's access to public services. I also contributed as a software developer for the QUT Motorsports club in developing their telemetric application.

## 🔭 Latest Project

I am currently working on developing an algorithm that performs spatial statistical rezoning to create regions that facilitate unbiased analysis. The first version of this algorithm has been published in the International Journal of Geographical Information Science, under the name [HeLP](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2023.2204347).
The second iteration involves optimizng the codebase and making it production-ready, as well as working on methodological improvements.

## 🌱 Learning

Looking to expand my knowledge in some areas of pure mathematics, in particular Number Theory, Graph Theory and Point-set Topology.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I would be super exicted to collaborate on projects involving spatial statistics, GIS or high-performance computing using CUDA.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

When I am not working on maths or coding, I am an avid fan of muay thai.
